## Description
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, video presentations, and the source materials/references we have used and created as part of the Mini Project for SC1015: Introduction to Data Science and AI.

This README briefly highlights what we have accomplished in this project.
## Problem statement
How do we accurately predict stroke using the dataset? Which model is best for doing so?
## Models used
  1. Random Forest
  2. Logistics Regression
  3. Artificial Neural Network (MLPClassifier from sklearn)
## Conclusion

## Lessons taken away from this project
Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods
Neural Networks, MLPClassifier from sklearn
Logistic Regression from sklearn
Collaborating using GitHub
Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
